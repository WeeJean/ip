# AI Assistance Log (A-AiAssisted)

**Tools used:** ChatGPT

**How AI helped:**
- Provided suggestions for structuring my chatbot code (e.g., separating parser logic, improving error handling).
- Helped draft user stories and think about incremental features.
- Suggested refactoring opportunities to make the code cleaner and more maintainable.
- Gave ideas for test cases and documentation phrasing.

**Examples:**
- Used ChatGPT to propose improvements to `Parser` and `Command` classes.
- Asked ChatGPT for code style suggestions (naming, clearer error messages).
- Requested test case ideas to ensure better coverage of edge cases.

**Verification:**
- I reviewed and edited all AI-suggested code before committing.
- I ensured all unit tests and text-ui-tests passed after changes.
- I did not copy suggestions blindly; I adapted them to fit my project design.

**Tag:** This project includes the `A-AiAssisted` increment.
